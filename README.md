# Main Features

•Upgrade or Downgrade Anytime & Anywhere  
•Manager Tools (Uninstall, Open Settings, Clean Cached Datas & Launch App)  
•Neat & Slick Minimalist UI  
•Swipe Down to Refresh  
•Lightweight Manager  
•Theme Selector  
•Easy to Use  

# How It Works

Depending on what variant or version the user wants to install, the manager will directly fetch that selected url data. Once completed, the selected file can be installed.  

All links are available publicly. IF, you know what it means then you know what it is.

# About The Project

The successor from our previous manager app that was released way back 2020 developed by xC3FFF0E and with the help of Sherlock Holmes.

We decided to create an app where people can easily manage and install all versions of the music streaming app from their devices.  

Our aim is to make a simple yet useful manager app for everyone's convenience. On this second version of the manager app, we added a couple of features such as the ability to uninstall, open the app's settings directly, clear the offline cached datas and launch the app. We hope that all users find these newly added features very useful.

# Origins Databases Officially Shutdown (02/24/23)  
Origins databases are now officially shutdown. Update to the latest version of xManager (v4.5) to continue using the app.  

**More Info:**  
> These are the databases used by our old manager up until xManager v3.4-v4.4.

# Legacy Databases Officially Shutdown (04/01/22)  
Legacy databases are now officially shutdown. Update to the latest version of xManager (v3.2) to continue using the app.  

**More Info:**  
> These are the databases used by our old manager up until xManager v1-v3.1. Those databases are very old and deprecated at the same time. That is why we decided to take them down.

# IMPORTANT NOTES  

•xManager was created using [Sketchware Pro](https://github.com/Sketchware-Pro/Sketchware-Pro) for android.  
•xManager uses [Sketch2Any](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sketch2any) to convert the project to Android Studio.  
•xManager only uses Firebase Database as its API.  
•No trackers, no spywares, no keyloggers or any other malicious codes added in the source code. What you see in the source code is what's inside the build apk. You can extract the apk for yourself.  
•The source code that can be seen here is what's inside the exported zip file for Android Studio.  
•There are some instance of the source code that are unbuildable, some parts might be missing and such due to limitations.   
•Users might experience downtime and maintenance when using the manager app since we are manually changing the hosting links of each individual file from time to time.  
•xManager is completely free and we do not get any commissions from it **(Rewarded Ads are optional and can be disabled in the settings)**.  
•We will support the app as long as we can. Internal improvements may not be guaranteed.
